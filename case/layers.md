# framedeck - layer guide

The acrylic case is built in layers.  I've included DXF files suitable
for laser printing, they use MM as units.  Layers are built in roughly
alphabetical order from the top down, but some layers appear twice and 
may be different thicknesses.

Around the edge of all the layers (except the last one) are holes to 
hold the whole sandwich together.  The A (top) and L (bottom) layers 
have holes sized for M2 screws.  The layers between have holes sized
for M2 standoffs.  You can screw into the standoffs from the top 
and bottom to secure the assembly.  You will need LONG standoffs...
I had to combine a couple to get them long enough.

The bottom two layers are held together with M2 heat set inserts.  
These inserts serve to secure the very bottom M layer to the bottom L 
layer and also provide fixing points for the mainboard and battery.

Please see this table below for full details of all the layers
