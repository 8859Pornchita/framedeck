# framedeck - printed parts

Here are STL's for the M2 to mainboard adapters plus the cable enclosures for 
the right-angle USB-C hdmi and keyboard cable.

The mainboard adapaters need two for each screw to sandwich the mainboard between them.
For the right-angle adapter, you can mirror for the other half and trim to length.  I
filled mine with epoxy to serve as strain relief and hold the two halves together.
